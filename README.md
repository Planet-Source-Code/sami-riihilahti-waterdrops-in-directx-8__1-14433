### Description

There are very few directX 8 applications, so heres one you like!

This DirectX 8 application demonstrates how to use DirectX 8 for advanced 2D graphics to create a rain effect.

This is a very good tutorial for beginners and also for advanced programmers. You can easily change water drop count. Also includes FPS counter to measure the performance. Requires 3D-card (It's also possible to create reference, but it's slow). Don't forget to write feedback!

Includes precompiled exe in case of problems with compiling. Currently only Win 2000 compliant until I discover, what is inside microsoft's head. (incomprehensible error. I always thought 1+1=2) :[
